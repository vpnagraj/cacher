# `cacher`

This repository includes a trivial Shiny app for asynchronous job submission / retrieval. The app submits a job to a queue (managed by a running Mongo DB) ... in the meantime, a script (see `lurker.R`) is running is a separate R process, watching the DB for new jobs. When a job (or jobs) appear in the queue, this script executes an arbitary process function (or functions) (see `process.R`) on with the parameters stored in the DB.

To run this example, make sure you have a Mongo DB installed:

<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/>

The DB should be running at `mongodb://localhost:27017`

R package dependencies include `shiny` (for the web app) and `mongolite` (for the R Mongo DB client).

```
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("mongolite")
```
